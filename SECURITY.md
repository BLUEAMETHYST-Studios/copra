# Security

It's not recommended to report security-related issues as a public issue. \
You should report critical exploits, which can be dangerous in a private conversation. \
You can for example open a contact us on [Discord]("https://discord.com"). \
For this, you can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jDAGR26yXe) and choose an administrator from the team. \
If you can't use [Discord]("https://discord.com"), due to your [age](https://discord.com/terms#4) or other reasons, \
then you can't contact us at the moment, but we are planning to setup an official email.
