# Copra

Copra is a compiled language, which compiles into Python code.

## FAQ

### Why, because Python is slow?

It's simple, Copra isn't trying to be a **HUGE** language, \
it tries to make the Python experience better, by offering another syntax to work with.

### How can I install it?

You currently can't, but when it is ready you'll find a guide in the [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/BLUEAMETHYST-Studios/copra/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md)

## Using it.

### Basic compilation of a copra script:

```
copra {filename}
```

### If you want to add more arguments:

```
copra {filename} {additional-arguments}
```

### The -o argument

When you place an -o argument after the basic starting arguments, the argument after the -o argument must be the path to the new output file.
